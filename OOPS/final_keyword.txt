The final keyword is used to create constants and restrict inheritance or modification.

(1) Final Variable - Value cannot be changed once assigned.
Acts like a constant.

(2) Final Method - Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
Useful when you want to prevent behavior changes.

(3)  Final Class - Cannot be subclassed (inherited).
Used for security and immutability (e.g., String class).
