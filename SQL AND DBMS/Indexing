Indexing is a database technique used to speed up the retrieval of data from a table

To reduce disk I/O by allowing faster data lookup.

TYPES :

(1) Clustered Indexing - here multiple records are stored together in the same file. 

(2) Primary indexing - the data is sorted according to the search key and the primary key of the database table is used to create the index.

(3) Secondary indexing - tells us where the data lies

(4) Multilevel indexing - segregates the main block into various smaller blocks to be stored in a single block.
